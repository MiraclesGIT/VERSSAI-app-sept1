          "market_timing_explanation": "The market for AI-powered solutions is currently experiencing rapid growth, suggesting favorable timing.  The score of 6 reflects this positive momentum but acknowledges the need to assess the specific sub-segment NeuralTech AI operates in.",

Lack of specific competitor information limits the assessment, resulting in a conservative score of 5.  Further analysis is required to understand differentiation and competitive moats.",

However, without detailed founder profiles, the score of 6 reflects an assumption based on the company name and market focus.  Further investigation is needed.",
          "execution_capability_explanation": "While 'multiple customers' and 'positive growth' indicate some execution capability, the lack of specific metrics limits a robust assessment.  The score of 5 reflects this limited visibility.  Detailed traction metrics are required for a more accurate evaluation.",

          "scalability_explanation": "B2B SaaS models generally offer good scalability potential.  The score of 7 reflects this inherent advantage.  However, the specific architecture and scalability characteristics of NeuralTech AI's platform need further investigation.",
          "unit_economics_explanation": "Without data on customer acquisition cost (CAC), lifetime value (LTV), and other key SaaS metrics, it's impossible to assess unit economics.  The score of 5 represents a neutral position pending further data.",
