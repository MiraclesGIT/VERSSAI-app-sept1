          "scalability_explanation": "B2B SaaS inherently offers scalability potential.  The 0.7 score reflects this inherent advantage.  However, the actual scalability depends on the specific business model and needs further validation.",
          "unit_economics_explanation": "Unit economics are unknown.  The 0.5 score reflects this lack of information.  Detailed financial projections and customer acquisition cost analysis are crucial.",
