  "executive_summary": "Michael Torres presents a compelling profile with his strong technical background at Facebook and MIT PhD.  His experience in AI/ML positions him well for the enterprise market. However, his CTO role raises questions about his broader leadership and business acumen, requiring further investigation.  While his credentials suggest a strong technical foundation, his ability to translate that into a successful B2B SaaS business needs validation.  Overall, he appears promising but requires deeper due diligence.",
