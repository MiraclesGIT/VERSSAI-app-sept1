  "executive_summary": "Michael Torres presents a compelling profile with his strong technical background at Facebook and MIT PhD.  His experience in AI/ML positions him well for the enterprise market. However, his CTO role raises questions about his broader leadership and business acumen, requiring further investigation.  While his credentials suggest technical proficiency, his ability to translate that into a successful B2B SaaS business needs validation.  Overall, he appears promising but requires deeper due diligence.",
