    "education_analysis": "Stanford CS degree carries a high signal, given the 0.23 correlation with success and relevance to the AI/ML field. This suggests a strong foundation in relevant technologies.",
    "experience_analysis": "Google product management experience is valuable for a B2B SaaS CEO, particularly in enterprise sales.  While no specific exit is mentioned, her time at Google likely provided exposure to scaling products and navigating complex organizations. This aligns with the 0.25 correlation for industry experience.",
    "network_analysis": "Her background at Google and Stanford suggests a potentially strong network within the tech industry, especially in Silicon Valley. This is relevant given the 0.18 correlation of network quality with success.  However, without more specific network details, we assign a moderate score.",
    "technical_analysis": "Her CS degree and product management role at Google in a technical field suggest a strong technical understanding, important for a B2B SaaS company in the AI/ML space (0.28 correlation).",
    "execution_analysis": "While her background suggests good potential, there's no explicit mention of her execution track record in leading a company.  We can infer some execution capabilities from her Google role, but lack data on direct startup leadership, resulting in a moderate score based on the 0.3 correlation factor."
