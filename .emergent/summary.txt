The AI engineer's work began with a user request to self-host n8n, which rapidly evolved into developing a sophisticated VERSSAI VC Intelligence Platform. This platform, now partially complete, integrates AI, RAG, and custom workflow orchestration for investment analysis. The previous engineer successfully established the core full-stack (React, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, ChromaDB) and implemented the Founder Signal Fit feature, leveraging Google Gemini Pro 1.5. A significant portion of the work involved fixing a critical bug related to inconsistent AI scoring by introducing deterministic sampling and caching, followed by enhancing the scoring explanation. The current phase involves integrating Google Search and Twitter APIs to enrich data for founder analysis, with dependencies already being installed. The engineer consistently addressed infrastructure challenges, like PostgreSQL connectivity, by implementing robust fallbacks like file-based storage.

<product_requirements>
The initial user request was to self-host n8n. This quickly expanded into a comprehensive requirement for the VERSSAI VC Intelligence Platform, an AI-powered system for investment analysis. The platform aims to feature six core frameworks:
1.  **Founder Signal Fit:** Pitch deck upload/sync for signal scoring based on research papers.
2.  **Due Diligence Data Room:** RAG-based document analysis.
3.  **Portfolio Management:** RAG and predictive analytics for meetings, board activity, KPIs.
4.  **Fund Assessment & Backtesting:** Reports on successful vs. missed investments.
5.  **Fund Allocation & Deployment:** Monte Carlo simulations for optimal fund repartition.
6.  **Funds/Vintage Management:** Performance comparison across funds/vintages.

Key deliverables included a complete database schema, integration architecture, RAG implementation, and a functional Founder Signal Fit frontend with real-time processing visualization. The platform was initially planned with n8n, but a custom AI workflow orchestrator was developed instead due to Docker limitations.

Currently, the **Founder Signal Fit** feature is implemented and production-ready. It includes pitch deck upload, AI-powered information extraction, and signal scoring using Google Gemini Pro 1.5. The system utilizes a robust FastAPI backend, React frontend, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and ChromaDB, with a custom 6-stage AI workflow orchestrator and a 3-level RAG architecture. File-based storage is used as a fallback for uploads. Recent enhancements include a detailed scoring explanation, and the ongoing work is integrating Google Search and Twitter APIs for data enrichment.

<current_work>
The current work centers on enhancing the VERSSAI VC Intelligence Platform, which has successfully completed Phase 1 (Foundation) and Phase 2 (Advanced Intelligence), making the Founder Signal Fit feature production-ready.

The platform boasts:
-   A React frontend enabling pitch deck uploads and displaying analysis.
-   A FastAPI backend using PostgreSQL for structured VC data, MongoDB for general data, and ChromaDB for RAG.
-   Google Gemini Pro 1.5 is fully integrated and functional for AI analysis.
-   A custom 6-stage AI Workflow Orchestrator () handles deck processing, AI extraction, signal scoring, RAG integration, and data storage. This custom solution replaced n8n due to initial Docker setup challenges, providing a more tailored VC intelligence workflow.
-   A 3-Level RAG architecture is active for Platform, Investor, and Company knowledge.
-   A file-based storage fallback () ensures continued operation for uploads and results despite persistent PostgreSQL connectivity nuances.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully resolved a critical bug where processing the same pitch deck yielded inconsistent scores. The fix involved:
-   Setting AI model temperature to 0.0 and using deterministic sampling (, ) in .
-   Implementing a caching mechanism to prevent redundant processing.
-   Replacing timestamp-based metadata with content-based hashes.
-   Sorting RAG query results for consistency.
This ensures identical inputs now produce identical outputs.

Following this fix, the user requested where is the scoring explanation?. The engineer enhanced the frontend () and added a new backend endpoint () to provide a comprehensive, research-backed scoring methodology, detailed score breakdowns, and individual score explanations.

The very latest user request, and the current task, is to in order to have more data part of the research connect google api search and twiter. The AI engineer confirmed this, initiated the process by retrieving integration playbooks for Google Search API and Twitter API, and is now in the process of installing the required dependencies in  to implement these new data enrichment capabilities.
